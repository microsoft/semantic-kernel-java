# 1.2.0

- Add ability to use image_url as content for a OpenAi chat completion
    - As part of this `ChatMessageTextContent` and `ChatMessageImageContent` was added that extends the
      existing `ChatMessageContent` class. `ChatMessageContent` for now defaults to a text content type for backwards
      compatibility. However, users are encouraged to migrate to using the builders on `ChatMessageTextContent` to
      create text based chat messages.
    - Constructors of `ChatMessageContent` were also modified to support this change.
- Added preliminary hugging face implementation that is still in development/beta.
- Added Gemini support
- Added OpenTelemetry spans for OpenAI requests
- Update the user agent for OpenAI requests
- Move XML parsing classes to implementation package as they are not expected to be used by users.
