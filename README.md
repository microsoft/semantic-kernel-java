[Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/)
is an SDK that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) like
[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction),
[Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service),
and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
with conventional programming languages like C#, Python, and Java. Semantic Kernel achieves this
by allowing you to define [plugins](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/plugins)
that can be chained together
in just a [few lines of code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/chaining-functions?tabs=Csharp#using-the-runasync-method-to-simplify-your-code).

What makes Semantic Kernel _special_, however, is its ability to _automatically_ orchestrate
plugins with AI. With Semantic Kernel
[planners](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/planner), you
can ask an LLM to generate a plan that achieves a user's unique goal. Afterwards,
Semantic Kernel will execute the plan for the user.

## Getting started with Semantic Kernel

The Semantic Kernel SDK is available in C#, Python, and Java. To get started, choose your preferred language below. See the [Feature Matrix](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/get-started/supported-languages) to see a breakdown of
feature parity between our currently supported languages.

The quickest way to get started with the basics is to get an API key
from either OpenAI or Azure OpenAI and to run one of the C#, Python, and Java console applications/scripts below.

### For C#:

1. Create a new console app.
2. Add the semantic kernel nuget [Microsoft.SemanticKernel](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SemanticKernel/).
3. Copy the code from [here](dotnet/README.md) into the app `Program.cs` file.
4. Replace the configuration placeholders for API key and other params with your key and settings.
5. Run with `F5` or `dotnet run`

### For Python:

1. Install the pip package: `python -m pip install semantic-kernel`.
2. Create a new script e.g. `hello-world.py`.
3. Store your API key and settings in an `.env` file as described [here](python/README.md).
4. Copy the code from [here](python/README.md) into the `hello-world.py` script.
5. Run the python script.

### For Java:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel.git`
    1. To access the latest Java code, clone and checkout the Java development branch: `git clone -b java-development https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel.git`
2. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/blob/main/java/samples/sample-code/README.md)

## Learning how to use Semantic Kernel

The fastest way to learn how to use Semantic Kernel is with our C# and Python Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks
demonstrate how to use Semantic Kernel with code snippets that you can run with a push of a button.

- [Getting Started with C# notebook](dotnet/notebooks/00-getting-started.ipynb)
- [Getting Started with Python notebook](python/samples/getting_started/00-getting-started.ipynb)

Once you've finished the getting started notebooks, you can then check out the main walkthroughs
on our Learn site. Each sample comes with a completed C# and Python project that you can run locally.
